This is the Perl interface to Yahoo! Search web services.

This package provides a simple but complete programmatic interface to
Yahoo's document search, image search, video search, news search, and
"Local" search, as well as its "related terms" and "did you misspell?"
features.

This uses their XML web services behind the scenes (no screen scraping), so
it is fast and consistent.

For more info about the underlying service this package uses, see
