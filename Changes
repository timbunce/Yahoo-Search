1.2.5   March 19, 2005
----------------------

  Added support for Y!Q contextual search (via the new 'Context' arg of a
  Doc search). As part of this, have any request greater than a certain
  size become a POST.


1.1.4   March 10, 2005
----------------------

  Added support for 'Lat' and 'Long' args to a 'Local' query.
  See: http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2005/03/enhancements_to_1.html

  No longer restrict a Language arg to a specific set of values -- let the
  web services return an error if the language is not known. I made this
  change because I suspect that the list of languages will be somewhat
  dynamic, and I don't want people to have to install a new version of this
  package just because Yahoo! added, say, Serbian to the list of languages.

  Removed the prepended "ERROR " from all $@ values -- dunno why I had it
  there in the first place.

  Documented %Yahoo::Search::KnownLanguage (and added
  %Yahoo::Search::KnownCountry).

  Documented $Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple

  Documented the PreRequestCallback argument

  Added support for a 'Country' arg to a 'Doc' query.
